            <text>en-week-old C57BL/6J, Ay mice and some ob/ob and db/db mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) either with or without intracerebroventricular (icv) cannulae in the lat- eral ventricle. All other mice were bred within our University of Mich- igan specific pathogen free facility and were used at 9 –11 wk of age. Mice with a homologously targeted leptin receptor allele containing an in- ternal ribosome entry site plus cre-recombinase within the 3ﰃ-untrans- lated region of the LRb-specific exon (LRbcre) were generated in our laboratory (16). Mice containing a cre-inducible green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter [Gt(ROSA)26Sortm2Sho; Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME] were crossed with LRbcre mice until double-homozygous mice (LRbGFP) were generated. Additional, C57BL/6-ob/ob and -db/db mice were bred within our facility using heter</text>
